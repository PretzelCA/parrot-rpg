## Text based Discord RPG about Parrots

### Developing
There's a couple of things you should probably know before working on Parrot RPG:

1. We use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for package managment, please also use yarn.

2. This project follows [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/), running `yarn test` should tell you if your code does not follow Standard JS.

3. When developing, you will need a [server ID](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-), [user ID](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-), and a [Discord bot key](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token).

When you get that sorted, go ahead and clone the github repo. Once cloned, run `yarn install` to install packages.

To run Parrot RPG, just do `yarn start` and Parrot RPG will start up.
